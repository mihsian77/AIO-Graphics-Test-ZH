AIO Graphics Test stands on the shoulders of open-source graphics projects and was
informed by the `3d-tests` reference kit. **No third-party `.exe` binaries are bundled** —
where a tool is listed as "reference", its functionality is reimplemented natively in our
own code. The one exception is the **DolphinVS** scene, which embeds the original Microsoft
DirectX SDK sample *data* (meshes, textures, caustics) — see the dedicated section below.

## Code we build on (included in this repo)

- **Khronos `vkcube` / Vulkan-Tools** — our `src/cube.c` is a fork of `cube/cube.c`
  (tag `sdk-1.3.239.0`), and we include its `cube.vert`, `cube.frag`, `linmath.h`,
  `gettime.h`, `object_type_string_helper.h`, and `lunarg.ppm.h` (the LunarG texture).

- **Noto Sans CJK SC** — the embedded CJK font (`src/font_cjk.inc`) is a subset of
  Noto Sans CJK SC Regular, subsetted to the ~316 characters used by the Chinese UI
  (`tools/gen_cjk_font.py`). © Google Inc., licensed under the **SIL Open Font License 1.1**
  (OFL-1.1). The subset is embedded as zlib-compressed base85 so the binary has no runtime
  dependency on system CJK fonts (which a pristine Wine/Winlator prefix lacks).

## Build-time dependencies (fetched in CI, not vendored)

- **Vulkan-Headers**, **Vulkan-Loader** — © The Khronos Group, Apache-2.0.
- **glslang** — Khronos reference GLSL→SPIR-V compiler, Apache-2.0 / BSD.
- **mingw-w64** — GCC cross-toolchain for the Windows PE target.

## `3d-tests` reference kit (analyzed for behavior; NOT redistributed)

The `/storage/emulated/0/Download/3d-tests/` kit guided which APIs and capabilities
AIO Graphics Test should cover. Credit to their respective authors:

| `font.exe`, `skyfly.exe`, `wave.exe` | OpenGL | classic OpenGL demos (SGI / Mesa heritage) |

## DolphinVS assets (embedded)

The **Dolphin** scene reproduces the classic Microsoft *DolphinVS* DirectX SDK sample. Its
original assets — the dolphin mesh (3 keyframe poses), the seafloor mesh, the skin and
seafloor textures, and the 32-frame caustic animation — are parsed by
`tools/gen_dolphin_assets.py` into `src/dolphin_assets.h` and **embedded in the binary**.
The renderer (the 3-keyframe tween, lighting, caustics) is our own code; the asset *data* is
Microsoft's.
